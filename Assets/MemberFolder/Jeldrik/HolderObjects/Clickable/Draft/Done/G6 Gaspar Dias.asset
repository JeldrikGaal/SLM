  Title: Gaspar Dias Ferreira
  Description: Gaspar Dias Ferreira was a merchant and part of the luso-brazilian
    elite. He is sometimes referred to as Johan Maurits' right hand man. Due to the
    representation of both major colonist nations, their collaboration was fruitful
    and lucrative for both of them - though not always completely legal.
